### üìå Project Overview
Implemented a comprehensive risk management methodology across all departments. Provided training and ongoing process support, collaborating on process mapping and mitigation strategies to improve operational efficiency. The project involved handling sensitive information with strict adherence to ethical standards, aligning with data confidentiality practices expected in financial environments.

**Situation:**  
TCE-RS lacked a formal risk management framework and needed to roll out ERM across ~80 departments, aligned with ISO 9001:2015, within one year.

**Task:**  
Co-lead the design and implementation of a lightweight, accessible risk methodology to build a risk-aware culture and improve process resilience.

**Action:**
- Conducted benchmarking visits to institutions with mature ERM practices.
- Led workshops and trainings to align internal teams with risk management principles.
- Co-developed a custom methodology based on process mapping and critical activity identification.
- Created Excel-based templates and reusable action plan models (aligned with ISO audit practices).
- Established a follow-up system with pre-scheduled review sessions per department.

**Result:**  
ERM was fully implemented on time across all departments. The initiative exposed previously hidden risks and long-standing process bottlenecks, enabling better planning, reduced operational uncertainty, and stronger compliance readiness.
